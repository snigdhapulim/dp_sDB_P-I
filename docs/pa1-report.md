**Exercise 1: TupleDesc and Tuple**

*TupleDesc Class (header & implementation):*

The TupleDesc class has been enhanced to include a TDItem class for individual field descriptions. Constructors for creating TupleDesc instances from types and names are implemented. Accessor methods for retrieving field details such as numFields, getFieldName, getFieldType, fieldNameToIndex, and getSize have been added. Utility functions like merge and to_string are implemented. Equality checks for TDItem and TupleDesc are provided, along with iterators for field traversal. Specialized hashing for TDItem and TupleDesc allows for hash-based operations.

*Tuple Class (header & implementation):*

The Tuple class now includes private members for schema (tupleDesc), record ID (recordId), and field values (fields). The constructor initializes a tuple with a given tuple description and an optional record ID. Accessor methods like getTupleDesc, getRecordId, setRecordId, getField, and setField are added. Iterators for field traversal (begin and end) are provided, along with a utility function to_string for field values.

**Exercise 2: Catalog (header & implementation)**

The Catalog class has been enhanced to support efficient table management. The methods added include:
- addTable(DbFile *file, const std::string &name, const std::string &pkeyField)
- getTableId(const std::string &name) const
- getTupleDesc(int tableid) const
- getDatabaseFile(int tableid) const
- getPrimaryKey(int tableid) const
- getTableName(int id) const
- clear()

These enhancements improve table management, information retrieval, and data integrity.

**Exercise 3: BufferPool (header & implementation)**

The BufferPool class is enhanced to efficiently read pages and manage buffer capacity. Key implementation details include:
- Using an unordered_map to map PageId to Page instances.
- Page retrieval logic in the getPage method, including page existence checks and eviction strategies.
- Fetching pages from the database file and updating the buffer.
  The enhancements ensure efficient page access while managing buffer size constraints.

**Exercise 4: HeapPageId (header & implementation), RecordID (header & implementation), HeapPage (header & implementation)**

The HeapPageId class, RecordID class, and HeapPage class are implemented as per the provided specifications. These classes ensure unique page identification, accurate tuple identification, and efficient tuple management on disk.

**Exercise 5: HeapFile (header & implementation)**

The HeapFile class represents a collection of tuples stored on disk with no specific order. It corresponds to a table in the database. Key features include:

- Tuple Description (td): Stores the schema of the tuples in the file.
- Filename (filename): The name of the file backing the HeapFile, typically associated with a table.
- File Object (file): An fstream object for file operations like reading and writing.
- Mutable Number of Pages (mutableNumPages): Stores the number of pages in the file (mutable for updates).
- Is Number of Pages Set (isNumPagesSet): A flag indicating if the number of pages has been set.

Functions:

- Constructor: Initializes the HeapFile with a filename and tuple description. Opens the file for reading and writing.
- getId: Returns a unique ID for the HeapFile by hashing the filename.
- getTupleDesc: Returns the tuple description (td) of the table in the file.
- readPage: Reads a page given its page ID (pid) from the file and returns it.
- getNumPages: Returns the number of pages in the file. If not set, calculates it based on file size and page size.
- begin and end: Provide iterators for tuple traversal within the file.

**Exercise 6: SeqScan (header & implementation)**

The SeqScan operator sequentially scans tuples from a specified table. Key characteristics include:

- Constructor: Instantiates with a tableid to identify the table to scan.
- Sequential Scanning: Scans all tuples in the specified table, accessing tuples through the associated DbFile.
- Iterator-Based: Offers methods like open(), hasNext(), and next() for tuple traversal.
- Tuple Output: Outputs each tuple as it's scanned, allowing further processing by higher-level operators.
- Schema Compatibility: Ensures scanned tuples conform to the table's schema.

In summary, HeapFile manages tuples on disk, and SeqScan sequentially scans tuples from a table, facilitating query plan execution.
